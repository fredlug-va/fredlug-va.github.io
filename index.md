# Moving day at Fredericksburg Linux Users Group (FredLUG) VA
Hello there - thank you for your interest in our local group for Linux interested people in the Fredericksburg area.

You're most likely here because you found a link on our old meetup page. Given changes happening on Meetup we've had to look for a new home for the group. For now that's [heylo.co](https://heylo.co). Future meetings will solely be announced there - please join our group there to see what meetings will come, who's the speaker and a lot more.

Join URL: (https://link.heylo.co/rCQi)

As a reminder, we have a mailing list that we can use to communicate outside of our meetings.

Mailing list join info: [https://lists.firemountain.net/mailman/listinfo/fredlug]

Please read the instructions carefully. To post the email address you use must be properly secured and easy to distinglish from a spam account. This typically comes down to how the mailserver is configured - and it's been my experience you find those mostly at the big sites like gmail, outlook etc. - this means that if you run your own mail server, there's a very good chance your request will be denied.  I highly suggest using an email address that you don't mind sharing with the world - the archives on firemountain will contain the email address and is technically searchable although for now it's disabled for public viewing.

Should you have unexpected issues using the mailing list, feel free to contact me on ego.alter at gmail dot com. 

Hope to see you on heylo and future meetings!
