summary: Installing Linux using Imagemode and more

# About
Do you remember when to install Linux you had to: Find a reliable source online, download 1 or more ISOs, burn these ISOs to real DVD-Rs, make sure your hardware had the right bios configuration and a hard-drive to install on, boot on the DVD-R and go through a very cryptic installer talking about primary partitions, boot partitions and boot loaders, kernel versions and parameters; and if you got this far, you had to login as root, define users, configure the system and then you wondered why you didn't get any sleep?

Those days are long gone - and even with today's improvements things keep getting better. Ted will talk about a new method called "Image Mode" - basically "bootable containers". You define a new system the same way you define a container. You even update the OS as you would a container.

If you're familiar with Image Builder this will be familiar except for using containers instead of creating a disk image with everything pre-configured on.
