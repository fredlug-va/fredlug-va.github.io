## About

SELinux was introduced to Linux in 2002 based on work by the NSA who later reached out to Red Hat to help implement it. 

A Linux kernel integrating SELinux enforces mandatory access control (MAC) policies that confine user programs and system services, as well as access to files and network resources.
