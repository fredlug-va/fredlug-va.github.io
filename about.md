[FredLUG](https://fredlug-va.github.io/) is a Linux Users Group who has in person meetings for people living in/around Fredericksburg Virginia.

We meet monthly to talk about Linux in professional and for hobby needs.   We are there for professionals that use Linux at work as well as beginners and students who want to learn.

[Our Schedule](https://heylo.group/fredlug) and group interactions are all located on Heylo. You have to have an account to be able to RSVP and join the group chats. A RSVP is required to see the location and video link to join.

However since we meet at the [Library](https://www.librarypoint.org/locations/eng/) at the 4th Saturday of every month, joining isn't required.  It does help when we justify to the Library to have us on the schedule to show how many joins and heylo provides this. We also have chats and other interactions outside of the in-person meetings. Some on HeyLo - some on our [Mailing list](https://lists.firemountain.net/mailman/listinfo/fredlug).
