# Moving day at Fredericksburg Linux Users Group (FredLUG) VA
Hello there - thank you for your interest in our local group for Linux interested people in the Fredericksburg area.

You're most likely here because you found a link on our old meetup page. Given changes happening on Meetup we've had to look for a new home for the group. For now that's [https://heylo.co](heylo.co). Future meetings will solely be announced there - please join our group there to see what meetings will come, who's the speaker and a lot more.
